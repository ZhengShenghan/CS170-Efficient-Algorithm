Overview
CS 170 is Berkeley’s introduction to the theory of computer science. In CS 170, we will study the design and analysis of graph algorithms, greedy algorithms, dynamic programming, linear programming, fast matrix multiplication, Fourier transforms, number theory, complexity, and NP-completeness.

Prerequisites
The prerequisites for CS 170 are CS 61B and CS70. You will need to be comfortable with mathematical induction, big-O notation, basic data structures, and programming in a standard imperative language (e.g., Java/C/Python). Another “prerequisite” for doing well in the course is mathematical maturity, or the ability to think about and work with proof-based math (which CS70 can help build).

Course Format
The primary methods for engaging with the course material are through lectures, discussion sections, homework, and the readings. All are important, and exams will test a mix of the material from these sources.
